description: "An AI-powered system for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of varicose veins using YOLO deep learning algorithm."
---


This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting varicose veins using the YOLO deep learning model. The system enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring, particularly targeting underserved areas such as rural India.

## Key Features

- Automated image processing for detecting varicose veins.
- YOLO-based deep learning model trained on a dataset of 300 labeled images.
- Web application built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.
- Cloud storage and authentication powered by Supabase.
- Supports live image capture and upload for analysis.

## System Architecture

The architecture consists of a client-side application for capturing and uploading images, a backend server for processing, and a cloud-hosted YOLO model for inference.

## Workflow

1. User logs into the system.
2. Uploads or captures an image for analysis.
3. Image is processed by the YOLO-based model.
4. Results are stored in the cloud database.
5. User views detection results and history.
